# AutoFeeder
this script needs to be seperate if you are playing the game normally and were using the main script to feed pets on site to keep functions like: editing your own user status or manually clicking event links
# What was the problem?
EC already uses Jquery 3.2.1 and imports it on pages for the main functionality of the site, I am unsure if that only conflicts with the specific extension i use or if multiple imports of it conflict with each other. However, if you are having issues, using this and temp disabling the main script will work, and may allow you to use other scripts you have created.
